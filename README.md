## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

    # install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
    require("devtools")
    devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/CodeAndRoll2")

...then simply load the package:

    require("CodeAndRoll2")

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

    source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2/master/CodeAndRoll2/R/CodeAndRoll2.R")
