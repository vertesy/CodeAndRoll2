\title{Export RStudio Command History with Timestamps}
\usage{
savehistory_2rstudio(history_file = "~/.local/share/rstudio/history_database")
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the written history file.
}
\description{
Exports the full RStudio console command history from RStudio's internal
history database to a human-readable text file. Each command is annotated
with a timestamp (year-month-day hour:minute). Multi-line commands are
preserved and grouped correctly. This does not rely on \code{.Rhistory} or
\code{savehistory()}, instead directly reading RStudio's history database.

The output file is named
\verb{command_history.YYYY.MM.DD[.scriptname].txt} and is written to the current
working directory.
}
\details{
The history source is RStudio’s internal history log
(\verb{~/.local/share/rstudio/history_database} on Linux). The log stores commands
as timestamped lines using milliseconds since the Unix epoch. These
timestamps are converted to local time during export.

This function is read-only and safe to run while RStudio is open.
